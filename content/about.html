---



<p>I was born in India and moved to the United States for my Bachelor’s degree in 2014. I did my Bachelor’s in Electrical Engineering in Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago. After graduating in May 2018, I moved to Charlotte and started my Master’s degree at UNCC. I am doing my Master’s in Data Science and Business Analytics. I love to travel, take pictures, and learn new things everyday.</p>
